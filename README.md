This is a (very preliminary, not yet working) implementation of a binary tree
in bash shell script. The implementation is called `avl.sh` and functions
(well, function, singular, at the moment) are prefixed `avl` since the
ultimate goal is a full implementation of AVL trees, just like you learned in
that 3rd-year CS course.

why?
----

The "because it's there" defence works pretty well, but I would actually like
to build an XML parser (also in bash), and I need to represent the DOM
somehow. An efficient (heh) binary tree will be helpful.


how?
----

bash is a fairly functional language, it turns out, with an unfortunate
amount of baggage that poses some challenges and idiosyncrasies. It is
ubiquitous - the JavaScript of the commandline.
